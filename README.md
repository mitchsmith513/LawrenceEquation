**A Deterministic Generalization of Quantum Evolution with Entropy-Producing Decoherence**


**Author:** M.L. Smith (2024)

---

## Overview

The **Lawrence Equation** introduces a deterministic extension of quantum mechanics that unifies unitary evolution with entropy-producing collapse. It modifies the standard Schrödinger equation by introducing two novel parameters:

- **Alpha (α):** A complex-phase deformation of the unitary operator  
- **Gamma (γ):** A localized decoherence term that models entropy growth and wavefunction collapse
